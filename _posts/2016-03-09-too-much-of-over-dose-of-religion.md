"Too much of over-dose of religion!

You know?

And then, one Maala of Tryambakam,

one Maala of Ganapathy Mantra,

one Maala of Trishati,

one Maala of that -

all the Mantras, all the prayers - thousand and eight times;

and then, Homam.

Then, call everybody; then, they also start.

Then, start 'sending' applications to Everybody - SHIVANANDA HAMSAAYA VIDMAHEY 108 times.

Goes on and on and on.

By that time, the child is absolutely fed-up with the whole thing.

You know?

Not necessary at all!

Over-dose of religion also is bad."

-------  SWAMI SHANTANAND SARASWATHI
